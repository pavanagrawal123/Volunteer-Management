## What is this?

This is a WIP application to help manage volunteers for my school club, Interact. 


The version available here is generalizable through build variables, but is not multi tenant. (Working on this :) ) 

Somethings that need happen, and will be happening soon: 
* Opensourced backend (WIP - removing hardcoded secrets (yikes) ) 
* Multi-tenancy
* Actual-Admin Portal, removinig need to fiddle with DB directly.
* Bigger abillity to generalize, this is really meant specifically for how our club does things, but I'll be working on fixing this issue soon.
